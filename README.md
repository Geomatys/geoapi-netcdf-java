# netCDF-Java based implementation of the OGC GeoAPI

This repository holds a netCDF-Java based implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) [GeoAPI](https://www.ogc.org/standards/geoapi) standard.
This repository is intended to be temporary and will be used to migrate the [existing wrappers](https://www.geoapi.org/java/examples/netcdf/org/opengis/wrapper/netcdf/package-summary.html) to the most recent version of netCDF-Java.
Once migrated, the wrappers will become part of the main [Unidata/netcdf-java](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-java/) codebase and will be made available for use as an optional artifact.
